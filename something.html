            <p class='p-popup'>With the help of Orthodox Metropolitan Alexy Prince Dmitry manages to repel the attempts
                of princes of Suzdal, Nizny Novgorod and Tver to take away his jarlig for the Grand Principality of
                Vladimir. After the war of 1375, Mikhail Alexandrovich, the prince of Tver, had to admit Moscow’s
                suzerainty over Tver. The Grand Principality of Vladimir united with the Principality of Moscow.</p>
            <p class='p-popup'>The white-walled Moscow Kremlin became an excellent fortified citadel that helped repel
                three raids of Lithuanian Grand Duke Algirdas on Moscow in 1368, 1370 and 1372.</p>
            <p class='p-popup'>In 1380, a Russian army led by Dmitry won the Battle of Kulikovo, and he added the
                sobriquet of Donskoy (of Don). In 1382, after Khan Tokhtamysh burned Moscow down, Dmitry had to resume
                tribute payments to the Horde.</p>
            <p class='p-popup'>For the first time (since the Mongol invasion), he bestowed the Grand Principality of
                Vladimir to his son Vasily I without asking a permission of the Horde. In 1988, the Russian Orthodox
                Church canonized him.</p>

            <p class="p-accent">The Millennium of Russia monument was erected in the kremlin (the citadel) of Novgorod
                the Great in 1862 to honor the millennium of the Russian state that followed the “summoning of the
                Vikings” to Ancient Rus.</p>
            <p class="p-content">It was created by a team of sculptors headed by artist Mikhail Mikeshin, who came up
                with the conception of the monument. Mikeshin secured his victory in the contest announced by Russian
                Czar Alexander II by depicting Russia’s history in its development.</p>
            <p class="p-content">The monument’s shape reflected the ideas of autocracy and civil freedoms whose
                combination, as the reformist czar believed, would profess the future of the Russian state: the
                monument’s silhouette resembles the Cap of the Grand Prince of Kiev Vladimir Monomakh that symbolizes
                monarchic power, and there is a bell whose ringing summoned a veche (a popular assembly) in the Republic
                of Novgorod.</p>
            <p class="p-content">The construction of the monument whose height is 15.7 meters and perimeter is 27.5
                meters cost 500,000 rubles, of which 150,000 rubles were private donations.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-container content-left">
            <p class="p-content">The monument survived the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution. But in the Soviet era, it was seen
                as a symbol of czarist autocracy, and on public holidays it was hidden under plywood with Communist
                slogans.</p>
            <p class="p-content">In 1944, during World War II, retreating Nazi Germans dismantled the monument and tried
                to take it away - unsuccessfully.</p>
            <p class="p-content">In 1944, the monument was restored and reopened, as the Communist government
                reconsidered its attitude towards it – such czarist Russia’s luminaries as 18th-century general
                Alexander Suvorov, 19th-century Prince Mikhail Kutuzov, 18th-century field marshal Pyotr Rumyantsev and
                19th-century general Prince Pyotr Bagration could become symbolic figures that unite the Soviet people.
                The monument was restored in 1995.</p>

                between the armies of Moscow and the Golden Horde, the centralization of power under Grand Prince Ivan
                III of Moscow, the beginning of the Romanov dynasty in 1613 and the proclamation of the Russian Empire

According to a chronicled legend, Olga, a pagan at the time, brutally revenged her husband’s death following the custom of vendetta.</p>
        <p class='p-popup'>To standardize collection of tribute, Olga conducted ancient Rus’ first tax reform to determine the amount of tax (“tasks”) and identify the “pogosts,” the sites of tax collection and outposts of Kiev princes’ authority in remote provinces. She started taxing beekeepers, fur hunters and fishers.</p>
        <p class='p-popup'>In 957 or 955, Byzantine Emperor Konstantin Porphyrogenites received her with honor at his court, and the Patriarch of Constantinople baptized her in the Hagia Sophia cathedral. That’s how Christianity began to spread in Rus, and soon, Olga had the first church built in Kiev.</p>
        <p class='p-popup'>Olga was one of the first Russians to be canonized as a saint “equal to the apostles.”</p>
        <p class='p-popup'>She pioneered brick buildings in Rus (first buildings in Kiev were Olga’s city palace and suburban house).</p>
        <p class='p-popup'>According to the Primary Chronicle, after Prince Igor’s death, Mal, the prince of Drevlyans, proposed to Olga. She falsely accepted his envoys’ proposal and recommended that they ask Kiev residents to carry the envoys to her court in the boat they arrived in from Iskorosten, the Drevlyan capital.</p>
        <p class='p-popup'>The Kievans obliged, but threw the envoys in a pit that’d been dug for them, and buried them alive.</p>
        <p class='p-popup'>Olga locked the next group of envoys in a sauna and burned them alive. Then she took her army to the land of Drevlyans and organized a funeral wake for Igor. She got the Drevlyans drunk and told her army to kill them.</p>
        <p class='p-popup'>Next year, the princess gathered a large army, took her son Svyatoslav with her and laid siege to Iskorosten for the whole year, but couldn’t seize the city.</p>
        <p class='p-popup'>Then Olga pledged not to revenge Igor’s death and retreat from the city if Drevlyans pay her a small tribute: three pigeons and three sparrows from each of their houses.</p>
        <p class='p-popup'>Relieved to hear the pledge, they agreed. Olga had the birds released with burning pieces of sulfur attached to their feet. The pigeons flew to their dovecotes, the sparrows – under the roofs of wooden houses – and burned the city down.</p>"
